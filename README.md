# HolidayTask

## Task

1) Write Implementation of LinkedList (without using Java LinkedList ready library), it stores int type of data and you have to write 3 methods: add, add at some index, delete at some index, get at some index.

1.1) Think about complexity of of methods for: add, delete, get by index ( O(?) )

 

2) Write Implementation of ArrayList (without using Java ArrayList ready library), you can use java simple arrays, it stores Integer type of data and you have to write 3 methods: add, add at some index, delete at some index, get at some index.

2.1) Think about complexity of of methods for: add, delete, get by index ( O(?) )

 

3) Write bubble sort using only java simple arrays ( type of sorting data: int)

3.1) Think about complexity value of your sorting method ( O(?) )

 

4) Write merge sort using only java simple arrays ( type of sorting data: int)

4.1) Think about complexity value of your sorting method ( O(?) )

 

5) Create binary tree implementation (type of data: int):

    a) Create method which insert elements in your BT and return to you filled/ready binary tree. You can send            simple java array

    b) create method which find  value in BT if it’s exist 

    c) create method which delete value in BT if it’s exist 

 

6) of course all your code should be covered by unit tests
